1. Project Overview

House of Emirates (HOE) is turning a series of physical and historical coins into on-chain digital collectibles (NFTs) on Ethereum. These NFTs will represent unique coin assets, each with its own metadata such as year, mint mark, condition, photo, and description.

The goal is to create a secure, audited, and extendable ERC-721 implementation, with a branded interface that allows the HOE team to mint NFTs directly and transfer them to specific wallets.

2. Deliverables

ERC-721 Smart Contract (Solidity, OpenZeppelin based)

Clean, audited implementation.

Constructor and minting logic accepting metadata URI for each coin.

Role-based controls (Owner / Minter).

Functions: mint, transfer, burn.

Decentralised Metadata Storage

Metadata (media file, attributes, description, etc.) stored on IPFS/Arweave for long-term availability.

Metadata JSON linked directly to the NFT via tokenURI.

HOE Branded Minting Interface

Simple web app with HOE branding.

Features:

Connect wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect).

Upload one media image per coin.

Add description, attributes (year, mint mark, condition, etc.).

Add unlimited custom attributes as needed.

Enter wallet address of receiver or mint to self.

NFT minted to chosen wallet on Ethereum.

Admin-only access for minting rights.

Deployment Scripts & Documentation

Hardhat/Truffle deployment scripts.

README with instructions for compile, test, deploy.

One test suite covering mint, transfer, and burn.

On-Call Support

Deployment support to Ethereum mainnet/testnet.

Assistance with metadata uploads and NFT minting.

Ongoing maintenance and troubleshooting.

Usage Flexibility

HOE can mint as many coin-NFTs as desired via the provided interface.

3. Technical Approach

Blockchain Network: Ethereum (Mainnet) with Polygon testnet for QA testing.

Token Standard: ERC-721 (NFT standard).

Libraries: OpenZeppelin for contract security.

Storage: IPFS/Arweave for decentralised metadata.

Frontend: React/Next.js (or equivalent), Web3.js / Ethers.js for wallet integration.

Wallet Integration: MetaMask + WalletConnect.

Security: Role-based access control for minting, gas-efficient contract design.

Testing & QA	Functional testing on Polygon testnet	2 days
Deployment	Mainnet deployment + Documentation	1 day

Total Delivery Time: 10 Days

5. FAQ

Q1. How can I view my NFTs once minted?
A: Simply connect your wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to OpenSea.io
. All NFTs minted to your wallet will automatically appear there.

Q2. How do I list my NFTs for sale on OpenSea?
A: Connect your wallet to OpenSea → Select the NFT → Click “Sell” → Set your price and listing details → Confirm the transaction.

Q3. Where is the NFT metadata stored?
A: Metadata (image, description, attributes) is stored on decentralised storage networks (IPFS/Arweave), ensuring long-term availability.

Q4. Do I need to pay gas fees?
A: Yes, minting and transferring NFTs require Ethereum gas fees. The wallet connected during minting must have sufficient ETH.

Q5. Can I mint NFTs to someone else’s wallet?
A: Yes. In the HOE interface, you can enter the recipient’s wallet address. If left blank, the NFT is minted to your own connected wallet.

Q6. Is this secure?
A: The smart contract uses OpenZeppelin audited libraries and follows best practices for security. Only admin wallets can mint.

Q7. What amount of attributes can I add?
A: You can add any number of attributes from the HOE interface before minting.

Q8. Can I update the details of the NFT once minted?
A: The smart contract supports metadata updates, but this functionality is not included in the HOE interface scope. Updates can be handled separately if required in the future.
