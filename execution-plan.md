# Execution Plan: House of Emirates NFT Coin Collectibles
---

## 2. Detailed Tasks

### Phase 1: Smart Contract Development
- Design ERC-721 contract using OpenZeppelin.
- Implement mint, transfer, burn functions.
- Add role-based access (Owner/Minter).
- Accept metadata URI in minting logic.
- Ensure contract is gas-efficient and secure.
- Follow OpenSea metadata standards for NFT JSON schema.

### Phase 2: Metadata & Storage
- Define metadata schema according to OpenSea standards (image, name, description, attributes, etc.).
- Store metadata JSON and media on IPFS using Pinata.
- Link metadata to NFTs via tokenURI.

### Phase 3: Branded Minting Interface
- Set up React/Next.js frontend with HOE branding.
- Integrate wallet connection using RainbowKit (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.).
- Implement admin-only minting UI:
  - Upload coin image.
  - Enter description, year, mint mark, condition, custom attributes.
  - Enter recipient wallet address (or mint to self).
- Connect frontend to smart contract (Ethers.js).

### Phase 4: Deployment Scripts & Documentation
- Write Hardhat/Truffle scripts for deployment.
- Prepare README with compile, test, deploy instructions.
- Provide one test suite (mint, transfer, burn).

### Phase 5: Testing & QA
- Deploy to Polygon testnet.
- Test all flows: minting, transferring, burning, metadata linking.
- Fix bugs and optimize.

### Phase 6: Mainnet Deployment & Handover
- Deploy to Ethereum mainnet.
- Deliver documentation and support for metadata uploads and NFT minting.

## 3. Support & Maintenance
- On-call support for deployment and troubleshooting.
- Guidance for metadata uploads and NFT minting.

**Note:**
- This is a real implementation, not a prototype. All data and flows will be production-ready.
- RainbowKit will be used for wallet connection.
- OpenSea metadata standards will be followed for NFT JSON schema.
- Pinata will be used for IPFS storage.
